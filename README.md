# Flesh and Blood Win Counter

This is a small python script to calculate your wins and win rates in paper Flesh and Blood, both with and without including Byes.

To install, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To run, just run `python main.py` and follow the prompts. It will ask you for your username (GEM email) and password, these values are not stored anywhere and are only used to authenticate with GEM in order to retrieve your match history.
